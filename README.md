## Builderz Solana dApp Scaffold (Nextjs13, Typescript & More)
current version: 1.0

This is our open source Solana dApp Scaffold for the Solana community!

Packages included and set 

Feel free to use it as a starting point for your next Solana project.


Also feel free to contribute by creating your own components, refactoring or other improvement.


## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:


```bash
npm i 
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.tsx`, you'll find `ThemeProvider` for light/dark mode, "ContextProvider", and "WalletProvider" wrapping your app, this is necessary for everything to work.

Although we are using Nextjs13 we are using the "old" folder structure as long as the "app" structure is in experimental mode.
